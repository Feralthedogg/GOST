## Recommended Path

1. Read [Getting Started](/getting-started)
2. Build one program from [Gost by Example](/gost-by-example)
3. Use [Language Guide](/language-guide) and [Standard Library](/stdlib-reference) as day-to-day references
4. Use [Diagnostics](/diagnostics) and [Testing Guide](/testing-guide) during iteration

## Deep Dive Tracks

- Runtime interop: [FFI Guide](/ffi-guide)
- Ownership/concurrency patterns: [Concurrency and Ownership in Practice](/concurrency-ownership-practice)
- Compiler internals: [Compiler Architecture](/compiler-architecture)
- Formal ownership model: [Owner/Alias Model](/owner_alias_model)
